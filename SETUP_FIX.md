# ðŸ”§ AWS Setup Fix Guide

## ðŸš¨ Current Issues Detected

### 1. AWS Credentials Issue
The credentials you provided seem to have an invalid format. Let's fix this:

**Please double-check your AWS credentials:**
- Access Key ID should start with `AKIA` (yours does âœ…)
- Secret Access Key should be 40 characters long
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

### 2. Docker Desktop Issue
Docker daemon is not running. You need to:
1. **Start Docker Desktop** from your Start menu
2. Wait for Docker to fully load (whale icon in system tray should be stable)
3. You might see a notification "Docker Desktop is starting..."

## ðŸ”„ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Start Docker Desktop
1. Press `Windows key`
2. Type "Docker Desktop"
3. Click to open it
4. Wait for it to fully start (may take 1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Re-configure AWS Credentials
Run this command and enter your credentials carefully:
```powershell
aws configure
```

When prompted, enter:
- **AWS Access Key ID**: `AKIA...` (your actual key)
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: `...` (your actual secret)
- **Default region name**: `us-east-1`
- **Default output format**: `json`

### Step 3: Test Everything
```powershell
# Test AWS
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Test Docker
docker ps
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Check AWS Console

If credentials still don't work:
1. Go to AWS Console â†’ IAM â†’ Users
2. Find your user â†’ Security credentials
3. **Create new Access Key** if needed
4. Make sure user has proper permissions (PowerUserAccess or Administrator)

## ðŸš€ Once Fixed

Run the deployment:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Radharapu Shiva\Desktop\Projects\Cloud Online Code Compiler\project"
.\deploy.ps1 -ProjectName "my-compiler" -AwsRegion "us-east-1"
```

---

**Next**: Start Docker Desktop, then run `aws configure` again!
